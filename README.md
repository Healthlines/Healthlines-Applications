#What is Healthlines

The Healthlines study was a five-year research project which aimed to develop and evaluate a new service, delivered by Solent NHS Trust, to support long-term health.

The Healthlines Study was designed to help identify potential ways to reach out to more people and promote self-care, self-management and greater independence. To do this, a team of researchers from the Universities of Bristol, Manchester, Sheffield and Southampton, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, NHS Direct and Solent NHS Trust worked together to develop and evaluate a new telehealth service.

This service was initially delivered within the context of NHS Direct. After the closure of NHS Direct in March 2014, Solent NHS Trust became the host service provider. The service was delivered for research purposes and is not being provided currently.

The service focused on supporting patients with two types of health problem: those at high risk of cardiovascular disease, and those with depression. This repository contains all the code relating to the following areas:-

1) Patient portal where patient can view previous interactions and add additional information. This includes a facility to support self-management of blood pressure.

2) Call handler management system (including call handling protocols for each patient session, patient management)

3) Administration tools (including importing patients, creating call handler scripts/flow)

4) GP messaging solution (including ability to send patient interactions through to patients GP)
